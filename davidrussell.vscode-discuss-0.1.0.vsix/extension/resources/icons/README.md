# Icon Placeholder

The extension currently references `resources/icons/icon.png` in package.json.

## To Create the Icon

Create a 128x128 PNG image with:

- Comment bubble or discussion icon
- VS Code-themed colors (blues, grays)
- Simple, recognizable design

Place at: `resources/icons/icon.png`

## Temporary Solution

For now, you can:

1. Use any 128x128 PNG as a placeholder
2. Or remove the `icon` field from package.json until ready
3. VS Code will use a default icon if not specified

## Design Ideas

- 💬 Speech bubble with code brackets
- 💭 Thought bubble with "< >" symbols
- 📝 Document with discussion threads
- 🗨️ Multiple overlapping chat bubbles
