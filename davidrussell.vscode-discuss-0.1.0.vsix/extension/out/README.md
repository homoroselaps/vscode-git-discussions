# Compiled Output

This directory contains compiled JavaScript output from TypeScript source files.

⚠️ **Do not edit files in this directory directly** - they are generated automatically.

## Purpose

- Contains compiled `.js` files from `src/`
- Contains `.map` files for debugging
- Used by VS Code to run the extension
- Gitignored (not committed to repository)

## Generation

Output is generated by:

```bash
npm run compile
```

Or automatically in watch mode:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Clean Build

To clean and rebuild:

```bash
npm run clean
npm run compile
```

## Structure

The `out/` directory mirrors the `src/` directory structure:

```
out/
├── commands/
├── providers/
├── services/
├── models/
├── utils/
└── extension.js
```
